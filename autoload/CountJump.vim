" REVISION	DATE		REMARKS 
"   1.00.007	22-Jun-2010	Added special mode 'O' for
"				CountJump#CountJump() with special correction
"				for a pattern to end in operator-pending mode. 
"				Reviewed for use in operator-pending mode. 
"	006	03-Oct-2009	Now returning [lnum, col] like searchpos(), not
"				just line number. 
"	005	02-Oct-2009	CountJump#CountSearch() now handles 'c' search()
"				flag; it is cleared on subsequent iterations to
"				avoid staying put at the current match. 
"	004	14-Feb-2009	Renamed from 'custommotion.vim' to
"				'CountJump.vim' and split off motion and
"				text object parts. 
"	003	13-Feb-2009	Added functionality to create inner/outer text
"				objects delimited by the same begin and end
"				patterns. 
"	002	13-Feb-2009	Now also allowing end match for the
"				patternToEnd.

"* PURPOSE:
"   Implement a custom motion by jumping to the <count>th occurrence of the
"   passed pattern. 
"
"* ASSUMPTIONS / PRECONDITIONS:
"   None. 
"
"* EFFECTS / POSTCONDITIONS:
"   Normal mode: Jumps to the <count>th occurrence. 
"   Visual mode: Extends the selection to the <count>th occurrence. 
"   If the pattern doesn't match (<count> times), a beep is emitted. 
"
"* INPUTS:
"   a:mode  Mode in which the search is invoked. Either 'n', 'v' or 'o'. 
"	    With 'O': Special additional treatment for operator-pending mode
"	    with a pattern to end.

	    " The difference between normal mode, visual and operator-pending 
	    " mode is that in the latter, the motion must go _past_ the final
	    " character, so that all characters are selected. This is done by
	    " appending a 'l' motion after the search. 
	    "
	    " In operator-pending mode, the 'l' motion only works properly
	    " at the end of the line (i.e. when the moved-over "word" is at
	    " the end of the line) when the 'l' motion is allowed to move
	    " over to the next line. Thus, the 'l' motion is added
	    " temporarily to the global 'whichwrap' setting. 
	    " Without this, the motion would leave out the last character in
	    " the line. I've also experimented with temporarily setting
